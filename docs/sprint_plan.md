## Total Story Points: 29

## Sprint Dependencies

1. Authentication must be completed before dashboard user-specific features
2. Mobile responsive foundation should be implemented alongside other features
3. Performance optimization should be applied to all new components

## Risks and Mitigation

    - Mitigation: Start integration on day one
    - Have backup auth provider identified
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**
    - Mitigation: Daily mobile testing
    - Cross-device testing plan in place

## Definition of Done

- Unit tests written and passing
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Mobile responsive on major breakpoints
- Accessibility checklist completed
- Performance metrics within budget
- Documentation updated
- Successfully deployed to staging environment
- Product Owner sign-off received

## Success Metrics

- Authentication system working with 99.9% uptime
- Dashboard loads under 2 seconds
- Mobile responsive design works on iOS and Android devices
- All critical user paths tested and functional

## Not Included in Sprint

- Advanced analytics features
- Template system
- AI features
- Integration hub

This sprint focuses on establishing the core infrastructure while ensuring quality and performance
from the start. The selected items create a foundation for future sprints while delivering tangible
value to stakeholders.
